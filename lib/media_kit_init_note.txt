NOTE: To ensure proper RTSP video playback, you must call MediaKit.ensureInitialized() before any media_kit API usage.

In this project, add the following to main.dart, before runApp():

import 'package:media_kit/media_kit.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await MediaKit.ensureInitialized();
  // ...rest of your initialization
}

This guarantees the media_kit platform is ready before any player is created.
